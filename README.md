# netbox-topology-views-icons
Set of SVG icons for use with NetBox and netbox-topology-views plugin. Of course they can be used for any other project, but the initial idea was to create a collection for netbox-topology-views. See also https://github.com/mattieserver/netbox-topology-views/issues/240
